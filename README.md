A 100/100 edition alpha release NFT was issued by GTL Type Label for this typeface, minting is live on Zora now: [https://create.zora.co/editions/0xb013e4f218760bb72f63f8d78a82b546c91897ef](https://create.zora.co/editions/0xb013e4f218760bb72f63f8d78a82b546c91897ef)

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://eliheuer.github.io/GTL001.
